# Bundle Size Comparison Report

Generated on: 2025-08-13

Each demo is a self-contained example of using the SDK (Gill, Kit Lite, and @solana/kit). Each demo generates a couple of KeyPairSigners, performs an airdrop, and transfers SOL between them. The demos are built to generate a bundle size comparison report using [compare-bundles.js](./demos/compare-bundles.js).
Check out [demos](./demos) for a comparison of the different SDKs. 
## Summary Table

| Kit Lite | 218.94 KB | 23 | 1.14x |
| web3.js | 627.68 KB | 21 | 3.25x |
